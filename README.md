Top 10 Algorithms for Coding Interview

The following are the common subjects in coding interviews. As understanding those concepts requires much more effort, this tutorial only serves as an introduction. The subjects that are covered include: 1) String/Array/Matrix, 2) Linked List, 3) Tree, 4) Heap, 5) Graph, 6) Sorting, 7) Dynamic Programming, 8) Bit Manipulation, 9) Combinations and Permutations, and 10) Math Problems. I highly recommend you to read "Simple Java" first, if you need a brief review of Java basics. If you want to see code examples that show how to use a popular API, you can use JavaSED.com.
